Detailed Explanation of the Code
The code begins by organizing the test case in a package named FitPeoPackage, which helps in structuring related classes in a logical way.

Several libraries are imported to enable browser automation, handle browser elements, execute JavaScript commands, simulate user actions, and interact with the webpage dynamically.

Inside the main method, the Chrome browser is launched using Seleniumâ€™s ChromeDriver. The browser window is maximized for better visibility, and an implicit wait is set to ensure elements have time to load.

The program navigates to the FitPeo website by providing its URL. After the homepage is loaded, the code identifies and clicks the "Revenue Calculator" link, navigating to a specific page for further testing.

To ensure the target elements are visible, the page is scrolled down by executing JavaScript commands. This brings the slider section of the webpage into view.

Using the Actions class, the program simulates key presses (TAB) to focus on the slider element. Once focused, it adjusts the slider value by repeatedly sending ARROW_RIGHT key presses. This action increases the slider value step-by-step.

For debugging purposes, the slider bar, highlighted portion, and the slider's handle are visually highlighted in red using JavaScript. This ensures testers can easily identify the elements being manipulated.

The numeric input field is located, and the program enters a value (560). Since clearing the field directly is problematic, BACK_SPACE key presses are used to remove existing values before re-entering the desired number.

The program validates the synchronization between the slider and the input field by comparing the slider's current value (retrieved using an attribute) with the value entered into the numeric field. The result of the comparison is logged to the console.

A set of checkboxes representing CPT codes is located on the page. The code selects specific checkboxes based on their position (the first three and the eighth). This simulates a user selecting certain options.

Finally, the program validates the calculated "Total Recurring Reimbursement" displayed on the page. It compares the actual result shown on the webpage with the expected value ($110700). The result of the validation is printed to confirm whether the test passed.

The program automates key user interactions, such as clicking links, scrolling, adjusting sliders, entering text, and selecting checkboxes. It also performs validations to ensure expected behaviors occur during the test.

By dynamically highlighting elements and validating critical data points, the code ensures both functionality and debugging ease during execution.
